# Changelog

All notable changes to kit-tools will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.3] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Orchestrator: orphaned process cleanup on normal exit** — `run_claude_session()` now kills the entire process group after every session completes, not just on timeout. Previously, child processes (pytest, vitest, node workers) spawned by Claude sessions survived after the session exited normally, accumulating across stories and eventually exhausting system memory.
- **Orchestrator: regression check process handling** — `run_regression_check()` rewritten to use `Popen` with `start_new_session=True` instead of `subprocess.run(shell=True)`. Timeout now kills pytest and all its children via process group cleanup instead of only killing the shell wrapper.
- **Orchestrator: graceful process termination** — New `_kill_process_group()` helper sends SIGTERM with a 0.5s grace period before SIGKILL, allowing child processes to clean up instead of being killed immediately.
- **Orchestrator: tmux cleanup timeout** — `kill_tmux_session()` now has a 10s timeout to prevent hanging if tmux is unresponsive.

### Added
- **Test metrics tracking** — New `kit_tools/testing/test-metrics.json` file tracks per-file test pass/fail counts, durations, timeouts, and last run dates across orchestration runs. Aggregated deterministically by the orchestrator from verifier results and regression checks. Portable JSON — no external dependencies.
- **Verifier: `tests_run` result field** — Verifier result schema extended with a `tests_run` array reporting which test files were executed, pass/fail status, and duration. Fed into test metrics for observability.

### Changed
- **Verifier: no more full-suite fallback** — When targeted test detection (T0/T1) finds no matches, the verifier is now instructed to identify and run only relevant tests from the diff rather than falling back to the full test suite. Prevents multi-minute test runs in large codebases during story verification. Broader test coverage is still enforced by the regression check and end-of-epic validation.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **New Skill: `/kit-tools:optimize-tests`** — Full test suite audit with six dimensions: mapping completeness, stale test detection, coverage overlap, performance profiling, KitTools convention alignment, and suite verification. Produces a structured report with actionable findings.
- **New Agent: `test-optimizer`** — Audits project test suites and produces structured JSON reports. Reports findings but does not modify files.
- **Orchestrator: failure type classification** — New `classify_failure()` function categorizes failures into `TIMEOUT_IMPL`, `TIMEOUT_VERIFY`, `TEST_FAILURE`, `VERDICT_FAIL`, `SESSION_ERROR`, or `UNKNOWN`. Stored in execution state for structured retry context.
- **Orchestrator: structured retry context** — New `build_retry_context()` replaces generic retry messages with failure-type-specific guidance. Timeout failures suggest scope reduction; test failures include the failing test name; verdict failures include per-criterion status.
- **Orchestrator: pre-flight checks** — New `pre_flight_check()` runs before each story's first attempt. Warns about oversized stories (>6 criteria) and test mapping gaps for files referenced in acceptance criteria.
- **Orchestrator: cross-story regression detection** — New `run_regression_check()` runs after story merge. Tests prior stories' changed files via direct subprocess (not a Claude session). On regression: reverts merge, halts execution with critical notification. Capped at 10 prior stories and 30 test files.
- **Orchestrator: learnings persistence across epics** — New JSONL-based persistent learnings file (`kit_tools/.execution-learnings.jsonl`). Up to 10 learnings persisted per execution, 5 injected into future epics. File-locked for concurrent safety, capped at 50 entries.
- **Orchestrator: test mapping gap detection** — New `check_test_mapping_gaps()` warns about changed source files without explicit test_mapping entries. Uses fnmatch for glob pattern matching. Deduplicated across stories within an epic.
- **Verifier: `pass_with_warnings` verdict** — Verifier can now return a third verdict for non-blocking concerns (style, naming, minor optimization). Triggers merge like `pass` but accumulates warnings in execution state for later review.
- **Verifier: `tests_passed` boolean** — Verifier result schema now includes a structured `tests_passed` field for reliable failure classification (replaces prose-scraping heuristic).

### Changed
- **Orchestrator: `detect_related_tests()` rewrite** — Complete rewrite with three-tier matching: T0 (explicit test_mapping), T1 (heuristic). Returns a dict with separate `t0`/`t1` commands instead of a single string. Directory-scoped matching preferred over global `**/` globs. Match caps: 3 for global heuristic, 5 for directory-scoped.
- **Orchestrator: extended source file filter** — `__init__.py`, migration files, Dockerfiles, Makefiles, CI config, and other non-logic files are now excluded from test detection.
- **Orchestrator: adaptive session timeouts** — New `run_claude_session()` timeout parameter with separate `IMPL_SESSION_TIMEOUT` (900s) and `VERIFY_SESSION_TIMEOUT` (600s) defaults. Optional `size: S/M/L/XL` in spec frontmatter scales timeouts.
- **Orchestrator: `update_state_story()` extended** — Now accepts `failure_type`, `warnings`, and `files_changed` parameters for richer execution state.
- **Verifier prompt: tiered test commands** — Test section now presents T0 and T1 commands separately with priority guidance. Full suite labeled as T2 (feature validation only).
- **`spec-completionist-reviewer` agent** — New dimension 5: "Integration & Wiring Completeness" checks for UI gaps, unwired artifacts, cross-layer connection breaks, missing configuration, and scope narrowness.
- **`story-quality-reviewer` agent** — New dimensions: "Anti-Pattern Detection" (vague verbs, compound criteria, unbounded scope) and "Story Ordering" (dependency ordering checks between stories).

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **`/kit-tools:validate-feature` → `/kit-tools:validate-implementation`** — Renamed to better reflect that this skill validates the implementation (code on a branch), not the feature spec itself. No behavioral changes.
- **`/kit-tools:complete-feature` → `/kit-tools:complete-implementation`** — Renamed for consistency with the epic-forward workflow. No behavioral changes.
- All cross-references updated across skills, agents, hooks, orchestrator, templates, and documentation.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **New Skill: `/kit-tools:plan-epic`** — Replaces `/kit-tools:plan-feature`. All work is now structured as an epic, even single-spec features. Removes the binary "epic detection" gate in favor of a "scope assessment" step that determines how many feature specs are needed (1 for simple, 2-5+ for complex). Always generates an `epic-*.md` wrapper alongside feature specs.
- **New Skill: `/kit-tools:validate-epic`** — Pre-execution spec validation. Runs four sequential agent reviews on every feature spec in an epic before handing off to `/kit-tools:execute-epic`. Interactive: presents findings after each agent, lets user revise specs and re-run reviews before proceeding. Produces a go/no-go readiness verdict.
- **New Skill: `/kit-tools:execute-epic`** — Replaces `/kit-tools:execute-feature`. Epic-first entry point: selects the epic from `epic-*.md` files, derives execution order from the Decomposition table. Retains all three execution modes (supervised, autonomous, guarded) and backwards compatibility for projects without epic files.
- **New Agent: `spec-completionist-reviewer`** — Reviews a feature spec for completeness: goals with no implementing stories, missing user flows, scope coherence gaps, and vision alignment issues. Writes structured JSON findings.
- **New Agent: `story-quality-reviewer`** — Reviews each user story for size (split recommendations), detail quality (flags vague criteria), ID format (rejects `US-001a`/`US-001b` — orchestrator incompatible), and integration scope (endpoint, auth, errors, data mapping must all be specified). Per-story verdict table in findings.
- **New Agent: `salty-engineer-reviewer`** — Adversarial pre-execution review using GAN-style discriminator thinking. Five lenses: "Yeah But What About" (error/loading/empty/scale states), "That's Not How It Works" (integration depth), "PM Said It Would Be Easy" (scope naivety flags), "Deployment Day Nightmare" (migrations, flags, backfill), and "Who Maintains This" (logging, ops, monitoring). Findings written in direct engineer voice.
- **New Agent: `spec-second-opinion`** — Independent cross-model review using Sonnet. Evaluates architecture decisions, feasibility, over-engineering, and alternative approaches. All alternative and over-engineering findings require explicit trade-off statements. Runs as the 4th review in the validate-epic pipeline.

- **`READ_ME.html`** — Single-file HTML5 documentation page with interactive 8-phase workflow flowchart, skills grid, hooks table, and install guide. Dark theme with phase-colored cards and agent badges.

### Changed
- **`/kit-tools:plan-epic` (formerly `plan-feature`)** — Step 3 "Epic Detection" removed. Replaced with "Scope Assessment & Decomposition" that always produces an `epic-*.md`. Single-spec epics get a minimal wrapper. All feature specs now use `type: epic-child` frontmatter. Step 13 prompts to run `/kit-tools:validate-epic` before execution.
- **`/kit-tools:execute-epic` (formerly `execute-feature`)** — Primary entry point is now epic selection from `epic-*.md` files, not individual feature spec selection. Falls back to direct spec listing for backwards compatibility.
- **`/kit-tools:execution-status`** — Description and body updated to reference `execute-epic`.
- **`/kit-tools:complete-implementation`** — Enhanced learnings capture (Step 3): gotchas → GOTCHAS.md, conventions → CONVENTIONS.md, spec-writing notes → Implementation Notes. Added context-aware next steps and updated Related Skills.
- **`/kit-tools:seed-project`** — Added Next Steps section and Related Skills table for clear handoff to create-vision or plan-epic.
- **`/kit-tools:start-session`** — Added guidance when no feature specs exist: suggests plan-epic or create-vision.
- **`/kit-tools:init-project`**, **`/kit-tools:create-vision`** — Related skill references updated.
- **`agents/story-implementer.md`**, **`agents/story-verifier.md`** — NOTE blocks updated to reference `execute-epic`.
- **`scripts/execute_orchestrator.py`** — Desktop notifications on macOS (osascript) and Linux (notify-send) for story failures, execution completion, crashes, and pauses. Fires automatically for critical/warning severity events.
- **`templates/PRODUCT_VISION.md`**, **`templates/specs/EPIC.md`** — References updated.
- **`README.md`**, **`KITTOOLS_UI_SPEC.md`** — All `plan-feature`/`execute-feature` references updated. `validate-epic` added to skill table and agents table. Repositioned from "documentation framework" to "framework for AI-assisted development."
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — Description updated to reflect framework positioning.

### Removed
- **`/kit-tools:plan-feature`** — Replaced by `/kit-tools:plan-epic`
- **`/kit-tools:execute-feature`** — Replaced by `/kit-tools:execute-epic`
- **`/kit-tools:migrate`** — Removed. v1.x → v2.0 migration is no longer supported as a dedicated skill.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Orphaned subprocess cleanup on timeout** — `run_claude_session()` now uses `Popen` with `start_new_session=True` and kills the entire process group (`os.killpg`) on timeout. Previously, timed-out sessions only killed the direct `claude` child process, leaving grandchild processes (pytest, node, etc.) running indefinitely and consuming CPU.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Smart test scoping** — Story verification now runs only related tests instead of the full suite. Tests are matched by naming convention (e.g., `foo.py` → `test_foo.py`) or explicit `test_mapping` in `TESTING_GUIDE.md`. Full suite runs only at the validate-implementation gate, with quiet flags (`-q --tb=line`, `--silent`, `--reporter=dot`).
- **Test output control** — Agent test runs use quiet flags to suppress per-test PASSED noise while preserving full failure tracebacks. Safety-net `| head -200` caps runaway output without hiding failure details.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Inline diff for verifier** — Verifier agent now receives the full diff content inline (up to 20KB), reducing tool calls and speeding up verification. Truncated diffs include a stat summary and instruct the verifier to use the Read tool for full files.
- **Fail-fast test flags** — Verifier test commands now include fail-fast flags for known runners: pytest (`-x`), jest/npm test (`--bail`), vitest (`--bail 1`). The full test suite (without fail-fast) is preserved for validate-implementation.
- **Completion strategy** — New `completion_strategy` config option (`"pr"`, `"merge"`, or `"none"`) controls post-execution behavior. The orchestrator now handles completion directly in Python instead of spawning a `claude -p` session for `/kit-tools:complete-implementation`.
  - `"pr"` (default): pushes branch and creates a GitHub PR via `gh`
  - `"merge"`: auto-merges to main (blocked if validation finds critical issues, falls back to PR)
  - `"none"`: leaves branch as-is
  - All strategies include artifact cleanup and tmux session teardown

### Changed
- **Pre-attempt HEAD capture** — Diff commands for the verifier now use explicit two-dot syntax (`{pre_attempt_head}..HEAD`) instead of three-dot merge-base syntax, eliminating ambiguity in multi-commit scenarios
- **Verifier review instructions** — Step 1 updated from "Read Changed Files" to "Review Changes", reflecting the inline diff workflow
- **`complete-implementation` skill** — Added note that autonomous/guarded mode handles completion via the orchestrator; skill is for manual/supervised use or fallback
- **`execute-feature` skill** — Added Step 2b (completion strategy selection) and pre-flight check 10 (gh auth verification when PR strategy selected)
- **Epic completion** — `run_epic()` no longer spawns a `claude -p` complete-implementation session; uses `complete_feature()` directly

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Epic automation state mismatch** — Skill no longer pre-creates `.execution-state.json` for autonomous/guarded modes. The orchestrator owns state creation with the correct schema (single-spec or epic), preventing schema mismatch crashes when running epics.
- **Epic state schema undocumented** — Added epic state schema to `execute-feature/REFERENCE.md` alongside the single-spec schema
- **Orchestrator crash handler timing** — Crash handler now registers before config load; config parse failures produce notifications instead of silent crashes
- **Leaked attempt branches on crash** — New `cleanup_attempt_branches()` runs at startup; `create_attempt_branch()` handles pre-existing branches from previous crashes
- **Archive spec safety** — `archive_spec()` now writes updated content to archive destination first, removes original only after success (prevents corruption if move fails)
- **Verify session errors unchecked** — Added `is_session_error()` check before reading verification result file (prevents reading stale results from previous stories)
- **Agent JSON output brittleness** — `read_json_result()` now handles markdown fences, preamble text, and trailing commas in agent output
- **Unbounded learnings accumulation** — Per-story learnings capped at 20 at write time (was only pruned to 15 at read time)
- **Scratchpad creation silent failures** — `create_scratchpad.py` now reports failure messages instead of silently swallowing errors
- **Placeholder validation false positives** — `validate_seeded_template.py` uses strict whitelist patterns (`[FILL:`, `[TODO:`, 3+ char ALL_CAPS) instead of broad regex that caught legitimate markdown
- **Checkbox detection inconsistency** — `detect_phase_completion.py` now uses consistent case matching for checked/unchecked boxes; removed stale `prd/` path support
- **Manifest gaps** — Added missing templates to SEED_MANIFEST (BACKLOG, AUDIT_FINDINGS, SESSION_LOG) and SYNC_MANIFEST (MILESTONES, BACKLOG, pattern docs)

### Changed
- **`execute-feature` skill (Step 6)** — State initialization split by mode: autonomous/guarded defer to orchestrator, supervised creates single-spec state directly
- **`execution-status` skill** — Token estimates display conditional on field existence
- **Network retry logic** — Rewrote `run_claude_session()` with clearer flow; explicit network vs non-network error handling
- **Duplicate code extraction** — Extracted `_store_attempt_diff()` helper, replacing 3 duplicate spec_key conditional blocks
- **Template versions normalized** — All 30 templates updated to version `2.0.0`
- **Story quality pre-flight check** — `execute-feature` skill Step 3 now includes story quality validation (vague criteria, under-specified stories)
- **`release-version` skill** — Now checks for template version changes during release

### Removed
- **Dead code** — Removed unused `summarize_diff_for_prompt()` function, unused `shutil` and `Path` imports from orchestrator

## [2.1.0] - 2025-03-04

### Added
- **New Skill: `/kit-tools:create-vision`** — Interactive, iterative product vision definition
  - Guided conversation to capture vision, users, value proposition, success criteria, and feature areas
  - Two-pass AI review: completeness scoring across 6 dimensions, then feasibility assessment
  - Surfaces gaps and suggestions between review rounds for user refinement
  - Produces `kit_tools/PRODUCT_VISION.md` — a singular strategic document per project
- **New Agent: `vision-reviewer.md`** — Reviews Product Vision documents for completeness, feasibility, and clarity
  - Scores across 6 dimensions: target users, value proposition, success criteria, feature areas, constraints, feasibility
  - Two modes: `completeness` (gap detection) and `feasibility` (implementation concerns)
  - Returns structured JSON with per-dimension scores, findings, gotchas, and open questions
- **New Template: `PRODUCT_VISION.md`** — Root-level strategic document (replaces `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`)
  - Sections: Vision Statement, Target Users & Personas, Value Proposition, Success Criteria, High-Level Feature Areas, Constraints & Assumptions, Open Questions
  - `skip_if: always` — created interactively by `create-vision` skill, not auto-seeded

### Changed
- **`/kit-tools:plan-feature`** — Step 1 now checks for Product Vision instead of Product Briefs
  - Reads `kit_tools/PRODUCT_VISION.md` for strategic context if it exists
  - Suggests `/kit-tools:create-vision` if no vision doc found (non-blocking)
  - Step 12 now updates both `BACKLOG.md` and `MILESTONES.md` with priority confirmation
  - Feature specs use `vision_ref:` instead of `brief:` frontmatter field
- **`/kit-tools:init-project`** — Template list updated: `PRODUCT_VISION.md` replaces `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`
  - Summary now recommends `create-vision` after seeding
  - Suggested workflow: init → seed → create-vision → plan-feature
- **`/kit-tools:migrate`** — Added vision/brief migration steps (12b–12e)
  - 12b: Creates blank `PRODUCT_VISION.md` if missing
  - 12c: Flags legacy `brief-*.md` files for user review (no auto-delete)
  - 12d: Notes feature specs with `brief:` fields (harmless, recommends `vision_ref:` for new features)
  - 12e: Completeness check for all expected v2.0 files
- **Feature Spec template** — `brief:` frontmatter field replaced with `vision_ref:` (references section in PRODUCT_VISION.md)
- **Epic template** — `brief:` frontmatter field replaced with `vision_ref:`
- **SEED_MANIFEST.json** — Added `PRODUCT_VISION.md` as Tier 1 (24 templates, 5 in Tier 1)
- **SYNC_MANIFEST.json** — Added `PRODUCT_VISION.md` to document tracking (20 documents)

### Removed
- **`templates/specs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`** — Replaced by `templates/PRODUCT_VISION.md`

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-01

### Breaking Changes
- **`kit_tools/prd/` → `kit_tools/specs/`** — The feature specs directory has been renamed. All internal paths, config keys, state keys, and tokens updated to match.
  - Config keys: `prd_path` → `spec_path`, `epic_prds` → `epic_specs`, `epic_pause_between_prds` → `epic_pause_between_specs`
  - State keys: `prd` → `spec`, `prds` → `specs`, `current_prd` → `current_spec`
  - Agent tokens: `{{PRD_OVERVIEW}}` → `{{SPEC_OVERVIEW}}`, `{{PRD_PATH}}` → `{{SPEC_PATH}}`
  - Orchestrator functions: `parse_prd_frontmatter` → `parse_spec_frontmatter`, `parse_stories_from_prd` → `parse_stories_from_spec`, `update_prd_checkboxes` → `update_spec_checkboxes`, `archive_prd` → `archive_spec`, `execute_prd_stories` → `execute_spec_stories`, `run_single_prd` → `run_single_spec`
  - Template directory: `templates/prd/` → `templates/specs/`
- **Run `/kit-tools:migrate` to update existing projects** — The migrate skill has been rewritten to handle the v1.x → v2.0 transition automatically.

### Changed
- **`/kit-tools:migrate` rewritten** — Now handles v1.x → v2.0 migration instead of the defunct dev-tools migration. Covers directory rename, file renames (`prd-*.md` → `feature-*.md`), config/state key migration, hook path updates, and documentation path sweep. All steps are idempotent.
- **`detect_phase_completion` hook** — Now checks both `kit_tools/specs/` and `kit_tools/prd/` paths for backwards compatibility with unmigrated projects.

### Unchanged
- `kit_tools/` top-level directory name
- `feature-*.md` filenames (renamed in v1.7.0)
- Frontmatter field names (`feature`, `status`, `epic`, `epic_seq`, etc.)
- Archive backwards-compat: `check_dependencies_archived()` still checks for `prd-{dep}.md` in archive

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Agile Alignment Refactor** — Corrected agile hierarchy throughout the plugin
  - **"PRD" → "Feature Spec"** — What kit-tools called a "PRD" was actually a feature-level spec, not a product-level document. All user-facing references updated.
  - **New: Product Brief** (`brief-*.md`) — Optional strategic planning document for new product areas. Integrated into `plan-feature` as Step 1.
  - **New: Epic files** (`epic-*.md`) — Explicit epic decomposition documents with goal, feature spec table, and completion criteria. Replaces implicit `epic:` frontmatter scanning.
  - **Feature Spec template** (`FEATURE_SPEC.md`) — Replaces `PRODUCT_REQ_DOC.md`. Removes Functional Requirements (FR-X) section and Success Metrics (moved to Product Brief). Renames "Non-Goals" → "Out of Scope". Adds `brief:` and `type:` frontmatter fields.
  - **`MILESTONES.md`** — Replaces `MVP_TODO.md` for milestone tracking
  - **`FEATURE_TODO.md` removed** — Superseded by feature specs since v1.3.0
  - **Generated files** — `prd-[name].md` → `feature-[name].md`
  - **`prd-compliance-reviewer` agent** → `feature-compliance-reviewer` — FR-X coverage check removed
  - **Backwards compatibility** — Orchestrator `check_dependencies_archived()` checks both `feature-*.md` and `prd-*.md` patterns. Internal variable/config key names unchanged.
  - **`/kit-tools:migrate`** — New "Agile Alignment Migration" step renames `prd-*.md` → `feature-*.md`, generates epic files, renames `MVP_TODO.md` → `MILESTONES.md`

## [1.6.6] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **New Agent: `prd-compliance-reviewer.md`** — Dedicated PRD compliance review agent
  - Checks acceptance criteria coverage, functional requirements, scope creep, and intent alignment
  - Runs as a parallel subagent in validate-implementation (previously inline in the skill session)
  - Standard FINDING output format with `category: compliance`
- **Diff summarization for validators** — Large diffs are now truncated per-file before being passed to validator agents
  - 60KB budget split across files; truncation notice instructs agents to Read full files
  - Agents (code-quality, security, fixer, compliance) include a note about truncated diffs
- **Prompt size guard** — Implementation and verification prompts are trimmed if they exceed 480K chars
  - Intelligently removes prior learnings and previous attempt diffs first
  - Hard-truncate fallback prevents context window blowouts
- **Result schema validation** — Implementation and verification result JSON files are validated on read
  - Implementation: requires `story_id` and valid `status` (complete/partial/failed)
  - Verification: requires valid `verdict` (pass/fail) and `criteria` list
  - Missing optional fields logged as notes instead of causing failures

### Fixed
- **Permanent error classification** — Context/token limit errors now cause immediate failure instead of infinite retries
  - New `SESSION_ERROR_PERMANENT:` prefix for errors matching context/token limit patterns
  - Orchestrator exits with notification instead of wasting retries on unrecoverable errors
- **PRD checkbox false positives** — `update_prd_checkboxes()` now uses `re.sub` with line-start anchoring instead of `str.replace`
  - Prevents matching `- [ ]` inside descriptions or hint text
- **Git operation visibility** — All bare `subprocess.run(["git", ...])` calls replaced with `run_git()` helper
  - Logs warnings on failures (non-fatal) instead of silently ignoring errors
- **Pause hang prevention** — `wait_for_pause_removal()` now has a 24-hour timeout with periodic log reminders
  - Auto-resumes and writes a notification after timeout

### Changed
- **validate-implementation Step 5** — PRD compliance review now runs as a subagent (prd-compliance-reviewer) instead of inline
  - Steps 3, 4, and 5 can all run in parallel
- **validate-implementation/REFERENCE.md** — Added PRD compliance agent interpolation table and large diff handling section

## [1.6.5] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Nested `claude -p` sessions** — Orchestrator now strips the `CLAUDECODE` environment variable before spawning subprocesses, preventing "cannot be launched inside another Claude Code session" errors
  - `run_claude_session()` passes a clean `env` dict to `subprocess.run`
  - tmux launch command also unsets `CLAUDECODE` as defense-in-depth
- **Orchestrator cleanup on error exits** — All `sys.exit()` paths now properly clean up tmux sessions, commit tracking files, and remove result files
  - Crash handler (`atexit`) kills the tmux session on unexpected exits
  - Guarded mode Ctrl+C, max retries exceeded, and epic dependency failure all run cleanup before exiting
- **Merge conflict handling** — Failed merges of attempt branches now abort cleanly and retry instead of silently marking the story as completed with an orphaned branch
- **Result file cleanup** — `.story-impl-result.json` and `.story-verify-result.json` are now cleaned on all retry paths, not just on success
- **Hook error handling** — All hooks now wrap file I/O in try/except to prevent tracebacks on encoding errors or permission issues
  - `update_doc_timestamps.py`, `create_scratchpad.py`, `remind_scratchpad_before_compact.py`, `sync_skill_symlinks.py`
- **Execution status tmux fallback** — Fixed session name fallback from hardcoded `kit-execute` to `kit-exec-{feature_name}` pattern

### Changed
- **Notifications** — Removed macOS `osascript` notifications; all progress is now reported through file-based notifications surfaced by the `UserPromptSubmit` hook in the parent Claude session
- **tmux lifecycle** — Orchestrator now kills its own tmux session on completion via `kill_tmux_session()`; no more `; echo ...; read` suffix keeping sessions open

### Added
- **Git health check in start-session** — `/kit-tools:start-session` now runs a git status check (branch, uncommitted changes, stash, remote sync, recent commits) before orienting on docs
- **Plugin discoverability** — SYNOPSIS template now includes a KitTools install note so new contributors to a project can find and install the plugin
- **Scratchpad behavior docs** — `checkpoint` and `close-session` skills now document their different scratchpad handling (preserve vs. delete)

## [1.6.4] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Execution Notification System** — Two-pronged notifications for autonomous/guarded execution
  - **macOS native alerts** via `osascript` for immediate awareness on completions, failures, crashes, and pauses
  - **`UserPromptSubmit` hook** surfaces batched notifications the next time the user interacts with Claude
  - Nine notification points: story pass, story failure (max retries), single-PRD complete, validation pause, epic PRD complete, between-PRD pause, all epic PRDs complete, dependency blocked, crash
  - **Crash handler** (`atexit` + `SIGTERM`) detects unexpected orchestrator exits, sets state to `crashed`, writes notification, and sends OS alert
- **Crashed status** — `/kit-tools:execution-status` now recognizes `crashed` state with resume/reset actions

### Changed
- **Repo distribution hygiene** — Removed test files and dev dependencies from the distributed plugin
  - `tests/` directory and `.pytest_cache/` no longer tracked by git
  - `pytest` removed from `requirements.txt` (dev-only dependency)
  - Added `tests/` and `kit_tools/.execution-notifications` to `.gitignore`

## [1.6.3] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **Unique tmux session names** — Autonomous execution now uses `kit-exec-{feature_name}` instead of a hardcoded `kit-execute` session name
  - Prevents collisions when running multiple projects concurrently
  - Never kills existing tmux sessions — checks for name conflicts and appends a suffix if needed
  - Session name stored in `.execution-config.json` so `execution-status` can find it
  - Falls back to `kit-execute` for older runs missing the field

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **New Skill: `/kit-tools:execution-status`** — Check progress of autonomous execution
  - Shows completion percentage, per-story status table, session stats
  - Detects stale state (orchestrator crashed/exited)
  - Offers contextual actions: pause, resume, attach to tmux, retry

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **Autonomous execution launch** — Orchestrator now launches in a detached tmux session instead of `run_in_background`
  - Fixes nested `claude -p` calls being blocked when launched from inside a Claude session
  - Fallback: prints a copy-pasteable command if tmux is not installed
  - Pre-flight check #8 verifies tmux availability for autonomous/guarded modes
  - Monitoring commands reported after launch (tmux attach, tail log, check state, pause)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Unit Test Suite** — 72 tests for the execute orchestrator (`tests/test_orchestrator.py`)
  - Covers PRD parsing, frontmatter extraction, story parsing with hints, result reading, prompt building, test command detection
  - PyYAML and pytest added as dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- **File-Based Agent Results** — Agents write structured JSON result files instead of stdout parsing
  - Implementation: `.story-impl-result.json` with status, criteria met, files changed, learnings
  - Verification: `.story-verify-result.json` with verdict, criteria details, recommendations
  - Eliminates ~33% false failure rate from regex parsing of LLM output
- **Branch-per-Attempt Strategy** — Each implementation attempt runs on a temporary branch
  - Creates `[feature-branch]-[story-id]-attempt-[N]` branches
  - Successful attempts merge into the feature branch; failed attempts are deleted
  - Replaces destructive `git reset --hard` + `git clean -fd`
- **Patch-Based Retry Context** — Failed attempt diffs captured and included in retry prompts
  - Shows the implementer what was tried before so it can take a different approach
- **Token Estimation** — Per-session input/output token tracking (~4 chars/token)
  - Logged per session and accumulated in execution state
- **Auto-Detect Test Command** — `detect_test_command()` finds the project's test runner
  - Checks: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `pytest.ini`, `Makefile`, `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
  - Skips npm default "no test specified" placeholder
- **Test Execution in Validation** — `/kit-tools:validate-implementation` Step 4b runs the test suite
  - Failed tests logged as critical findings; passing tests noted in summary
  - Graceful fallback if no test command detected
- **Auto-Injected Test Criteria** — `/kit-tools:plan-feature` adds test criteria to every code story
  - "Tests written/updated for new functionality" and "Full test suite passes" auto-appended
  - Doc/config-only stories exempt
- **Implementation Hints** — Per-story hints flow from planning to implementation
  - `plan-feature` generates hints during refinement (key files, patterns, gotchas)
  - `parse_stories_from_prd()` extracts `**Implementation Hints:**` blocks
  - Implementer agent receives hints to reduce exploration time
- **Pause on Critical Findings** — Autonomous execution pauses when validation finds critical issues
  - Creates `.pause_execution` file referencing `AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`
  - Resumes when file is removed after review
  - Only in autonomous mode; supervised/guarded modes just report

### Changed
- **YAML Parsing** — Replaced hand-rolled frontmatter parser with PyYAML (`yaml.safe_load()`)
  - Properly handles lists, booleans, nested values, edge cases
  - Dates auto-converted to ISO strings for backward compatibility
- **Verifier Independence** — Verifier receives git-sourced file lists, not implementer claims
  - `build_verification_prompt()` takes `files_changed_from_git` from `git diff --name-only`
  - "Evidence from Implementer" section removed from verifier template
- **Reference-Based Context** — All agent prompts reference file paths instead of inlining full contents
  - `{{CODE_ARCH_PATH}}`, `{{CONVENTIONS_PATH}}`, etc. replace `{{CODE_ARCH}}`, `{{CONVENTIONS}}`
  - Applies to implementer, verifier, code-quality-validator, security-reviewer, and feature-fixer agents
  - Agents read context on-demand via their Read tool
  - Prompts shrink ~80% for large projects
- **Skill Structure** — 4 pipeline skills split into SKILL.md (workflow) + REFERENCE.md (details)
  - `execute-feature`: 509 -> 139 lines SKILL.md + 226 lines REFERENCE.md
  - `plan-feature`: 647 -> 177 lines SKILL.md + 211 lines REFERENCE.md
  - `validate-implementation`: 414 -> 141 lines SKILL.md + 159 lines REFERENCE.md
  - `complete-implementation`: 293 -> 101 lines SKILL.md + 127 lines REFERENCE.md
- **PRD Template** — Updated to v1.3.0 with Implementation Hints section and test criteria

### Fixed
- **`validate_setup.py`** — No longer silently exits when called without stdin (e.g., from init-project Step 7)
- **`remind_close_session.py`** — Checks for actual content below `## Notes` instead of line count heuristic, preventing false positives after context compactions
- **`test_normalizes_verdict_to_lowercase`** — Fixed broken test that passed a directory instead of using the actual result file path

### Removed
- **Deprecated functions** — Removed `parse_verification_result()`, `_fallback_verdict_scan()`, `extract_combined_learnings()`, `extract_section()`, `reset_to_commit()` from orchestrator (superseded by file-based JSON and branch-per-attempt)
- **`hooks/hooks.json`** — Removed legacy hook config file (superseded by `plugin.json` hooks section since v1.1.0)

## [1.5.4] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **Hook path resolution** — Project-level hook commands now use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` instead of relative paths
  - Hooks previously used `python3 kit_tools/hooks/...` which breaks when shell CWD drifts during a session
  - Now uses `python3 "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/kit_tools/hooks/..."` which resolves correctly regardless of CWD
  - Fixes infinite loop where a Stop hook file-not-found error re-triggers the Stop event
  - `/kit-tools:init-project` writes the correct absolute-path commands into `.claude/settings.local.json`
  - `/kit-tools:update-kit-tools` documentation updated to reflect the new path convention

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Epic Chaining for Execute-Feature Pipeline** — Multi-PRD epics now execute automatically on a shared branch
  - PRD template gains `epic`, `epic_seq`, `epic_final` frontmatter fields
  - `/kit-tools:execute-feature` detects epic PRDs, offers sequential execution with pause-between-PRDs option
  - Orchestrator chains PRDs: stories → validate → tag checkpoint → archive → next PRD
  - Hard dependency gate: blocks PRD execution if `depends_on` PRDs aren't archived
  - Git tags mark each PRD checkpoint (`[epic]/[feature]-complete`)
  - Resume support: skips already-completed PRDs on restart
  - Cross-PRD learnings carried forward to subsequent PRD story prompts
- **Epic-Aware Completion** — `/kit-tools:complete-implementation` handles mid-epic and final-epic PRDs
  - Mid-epic: tag + archive only, no PR or artifact cleanup
  - Final epic PRD: PR references all PRDs and checkpoint tags
- **Pause Between PRDs** — New `epic_pause_between_prds` config option
  - Drops a pause file after each PRD completes for user review
  - Recommended default for epic execution

### Fixed
- **Verifier structured output parsing** — `parse_verification_result()` now strips markdown code fences before regex search, fixing ~33% false failure rate when LLMs wrap output in triple backticks
  - Added fallback verdict detection: scans for `verdict: pass` and natural language pass/fail signals when structured block is missing
  - Logs raw verifier output tail on parse failure for diagnosis
- **Verification-only retry** — When implementation succeeded but verifier output couldn't be parsed, retries now skip re-implementation and only re-run verification (saves a full implementation session per retry)
- **Failure detail sanitization** — `log_story_failure()` no longer dumps raw template/session content into `EXECUTION_LOG.md`; extracts first meaningful line and truncates
- **Verifier template hardening** — `story-verifier.md` now explicitly instructs the LLM to output the structured block as plain text, not inside code fences

### Changed
- **`execute_orchestrator.py`** — Refactored into `run_single_prd()` and `run_epic()` with shared `execute_prd_stories()` loop
  - `update_state_story()` accepts `prd_key` for epic nested state
  - `build_implementation_prompt()` gathers cross-PRD learnings in epic mode
  - `log_completion()` aggregates stats across all PRDs in epic mode
- **`/kit-tools:plan-feature`** — Step 2b now sets epic chaining fields; Step 10 includes epic fields in frontmatter template
- **`/kit-tools:execute-feature`** — Epic detection in Step 1, dependency hard gate in Step 3, `epic/[name]` branching in Step 4, `epic_prds` config format in Step 7

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **New Skill: `/kit-tools:validate-implementation`** — Full branch-level validation against PRD
  - Reviews entire `git diff main...HEAD` — all changes across the feature, not just recent edits
  - Three independent review passes: code quality, security, and PRD compliance
  - PRD compliance checks acceptance criteria coverage, functional requirements, and scope creep
  - Automatic fix loop (max 3 iterations) for critical findings
  - Autonomous mode: spawns fixer agent; supervised mode: fixes inline
  - Logs remaining findings to `kit_tools/AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`
- **New Agent: `security-reviewer.md`** — Dedicated security review agent

- **`checkpoint/SKILL.md`** — Replaced validate-implementation invocation with inline quality check using code-quality-validator agent directly
- **`detect_phase_completion.py`** — Suggests validate-implementation instead of validate-phase
- **`init-project/SKILL.md`** — References updated to validate-implementation
- **`README.md`** — Skills table, hooks table, and "Code Quality Validation" section rewritten as "Feature Validation"
- **`templates/AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`** — References updated to validate-implementation

### Removed
- **`/kit-tools:validate-phase`** — Replaced by validate-implementation (branch-level validation)

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **New Skill: `/kit-tools:sync-symlinks`** — Force-refresh skill symlinks after a plugin update
  - Reads `installed_plugins.json` to find correct install path
  - Runs sync script with the authoritative path
  - Useful when skills appear stale after `/plugin update`

### Fixed
- **`sync_skill_symlinks` hook** — Now reads `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` as the source of truth for the plugin install path, instead of solely trusting `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`
  - Fixes issue where skill symlinks remained pointed at the previous version after a plugin update
  - Falls back to `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` if `installed_plugins.json` is unavailable

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-06
